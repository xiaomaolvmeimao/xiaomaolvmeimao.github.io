My guest lecture on course "Machine Learning" 2019 spring, prof. Hung-yi Lee.

## Outline:

1. Introduction to syntax parsing and LM
2. Unsupervised syntax parsing by LM with tree structure assumption and _gating connection_ ([Neural Language Modeling by Jointly Learning Syntax and Lexicon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02013))
3. Unsupervised syntax parsing by LM with tree structure assumption and _ordered neural_ ([Ordered Neurons: Integrating Tree Structures into Recurrent Neural Networksâ€‹](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09536))
